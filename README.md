The goal of this project is to tackle the computer vision task of image classification, and the
subjects are fruits found in Cambodia. The approach is to utilize a subset of machine learning called Transfer Learning. Transfer learning is the chosen method due to time and computational constraints, and the lack of sufficiently large dataset. An 86% accuracy was achieved with the ResNet50 model.

## Key Takeaways:
• Seamlessly integrated the trained model into a user-friendly web application using React.js and JavaScript

• Incorporated Material-UI components to enhance the user interface and visual appeal

• Utilized TensorFlow and Keras frameworks to train a robust image classification model

• Curated and preprocessed a diverse dataset consisting of 2600 images

• Leveraged TensorFlow.js to load the trained model in the browser, eliminating the need for server-side computations and improving the application's responsiveness
